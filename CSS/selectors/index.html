    <h1 class="heading1">Exception Handling In Java</h1>
    <p id="para1">Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved. Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.</p>
    <h1>What are Java Exceptions?</h1>
    <p class="para2">In Java, Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program, i.e. at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions. Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program. When an exception occurs within a method, it creates an object. This object is called the exception object. It contains information about the exception, such as the name and description of the exception and the state of the program when the exception occurred.</p>
    <h2>Major reasons why an exception Occurs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Invalid user input</li>
        <li>Device failure</li>
        <li>Loss of network connection</li>
        <li>Physical limitations (out-of-disk memory)</li>
        <li>Code errors</li>
        <li>Opening an unavailable file</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para3"><b>Errors</b> represent irrecoverable conditions such as Java virtual machine (JVM) running out of memory, memory leaks, stack overflow errors, library incompatibility, infinite recursion, etc. Errors are usually beyond the control of the programmer, and we should not try to handle errors.</p>
